# Algorithms and Data Structures
Following this course material[Algorithms and Data Structures Tutorial](https//www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlyxKli)

## Summary
This is a full course from Treehouse that covers the basics of algorithms and data structures. The course is taught by Passan, an instructor at Treehouse, and is intended for high school or college students, developers, or anyone learning to code. The course is designed to dispel the notion that algorithms are only for people with computer science degrees and to help people become comfortable with the basics of algorithms. The course covers the tools needed to evaluate algorithms and understand how they perform. The course uses the Python programming language and requires some programming experience. The course covers the definition of an algorithm, why it's important to know about algorithms, and how to identify which algorithm is best for a given task.

## What is Algoritham
A set of steps or instructions for completing a task.

Examples
- Racipe
- Morning routine
- Map direction

In computer science, algorithm means a set of steps a program takes to finish a task.
